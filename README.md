# hello-world

Hello everyone,
my name is Kaizayra and I'll be joining the Github community to start learning the awesomeness of programming. I had a backgorund in multimedia computing prior to this but the course didn't focus primarily on the programming part. In hopes of joining an open source community I could improve my programming skills and contribute more towards the community. That is all I have to say.

Happy typing!
